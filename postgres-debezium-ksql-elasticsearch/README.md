# Overview

This demo shows how to enrich event stream data with CDC data from Postgres and then stream into Elasticsearch.

You may follow the [step-by-step guide](postgres-debezium-ksql-elasticsearch-docker-short.adoc), and that instruction is based on Docker (instead of your local Confluent Platform install).
