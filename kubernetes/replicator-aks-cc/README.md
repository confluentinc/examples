# Azure Kubernetes Service to Confluent Cloud with Confluent Replicator

This example features a deployment of Confluent Platform on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) leveraging Confluent Operator and Confluent Replicator, highlighting a data replication strategy to Confluent Cloud. Upon running this demo, you will have a AKS based Confluent Platform deployment with simulated data replicating to your Confluent Cloud cluster. We will verify the replication by running client applications against the Confluent Cloud cluster to view the simulated data originating in the source AKS cluster.
