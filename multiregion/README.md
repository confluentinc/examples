# Overview

This demo showcases Confluent Platform's Multi-Region Replication capability built directly into Confluent Server starting with release 5.4.

For more information:

* [Blog post: Built-In Multi-Region Replication with Confluent Platform 5.4-preview](https://www.confluent.io/blog/multi-region-data-replication?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.examples_type.community_content.multiregion)
* [Confluent Platform documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/multi-dc-deployments/multi-region.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.examples_type.community_content.multiregion)

NOTE: There is a [different demo](../multi-datacenter/README.md) for a multi-datacenter design with two instances of Confluent Replicator copying data bidirectionally between the datacenters.

## Multi-region Architecture

This demo has the following architecture.
There are three regions `west`, `central`, and `east`.
The naming convention of the brokers are `broker-[region]-[broker_id]`.

![image](images/multi-region-base-v2.png)

## Configurations

The full broker configurations are in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.
Here are some relevant configuration parameters that are used by Multi-Region Replication.

### Broker
* `broker.rack`: identifies the location of the broker. For the demo, it represents a region, either `east` or `west`
* `replica.selector.class=org.apache.kafka.common.replica.RackAwareReplicaSelector`: allows clients to read from followers (in contrast, clients are typically only allowed to read from leaders)

### Client
* `client.rack`: identifies the location of the client. For the demo, it represents a region, either `east` or `west`

### Topic
* `--replica-placement <path-to-replica-placement-policy-json>`: at topic creation, this defines the replica placement policy for a given topic

## Concepts

_Replicas_ are brokers assigned to a topic-partition, and they can be a _Leader_, _Follower_, or _Observer_.
A _Leader_ is the broker/replica accepting produce messages.
A _Follower_ is a broker/replica that can join an ISR list and participate in the calculation of the high watermark (used by the leader when acknowledging messages back to the producer).

An _ISR_ list (in-sync replicas) includes brokers that have a given topic-partition.
The data is copied from the leader to every member of the ISR before the producer gets an acknowledgement.
The followers in an ISR can become the leader if the current leader fails.

An _Observer_ is a broker/replica that also has a copy of data for a given topic-partition, and consumers are allowed to read from them even though it is not the leader (known as "Follower Fetching").
However, the data is copied asynchronously from the leader such that a producer does not wait on observers to get back an acknowledgement.
By default, observers do not participate in the ISR list and cannot automatically become the leader if the current leader fails, but if a user manually changes leader assignment then they can participate in the ISR list.

# Run the Demo

## Install the demo

Clone the [confluentinc/examples GitHub repo](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples) and checkout the `master` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/examples
cd examples
git checkout master
cd multiregion
```

## Start Docker Compose

Run the following command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

You should see the following Docker containers with `docker-compose ps`:

```
      Name                   Command            State                            Ports

```

## Inject latency and packet loss

This demo injects latency between the regions and packet loss to simulate the WAN link.
It uses [Pumba](https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba).

![image](images/multi-region-latencies-v2.png)

Run the Dockerized Pumba scripts:

```
./scripts/latency_docker.sh
```

You should see the following Docker containers with `docker container ls --filter "name=pumba"`:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

View IP addresses in the demo:

```
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} - {{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' $(docker ps -aq)
```

## Create Topics

Create three Kafka topics by running the following script.

```
./scripts/create-topics.sh
```

The script creates each topic with a different replica placement policy that specifies a set of matching constraints, i.e., `count` and `rack` for `replicas` and `observers`.
The replica placement policy file is defined with the argument `--replica-placement <path-to-replica-placement-policy-json>` mentioned earlier (these files are in the [config](config/) directory).
Each placement also has a minimum `count` associated with it that allows users to guarantee a certain spread of replicas throughout the cluster.

| Topic name         | Leader  | Followers (sync replicas) | Observers (async replicas) | ISR list  |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| single-region      | 1x west | 1x west                   | n/a                        | {1,2}     |
| multi-region-sync  | 1x west | 1x west, 2x east          | n/a                        | {1,2,3,4} |
| multi-region-async | 1x west | 1x west                   | 2x east                    | {1,2}     |

The playbook below highlights client performance differences between these topics depending on the relative location of clients and brokers.

![image](images/multi-region-topic-replicas-v2.png)

Verify topic replica placement:

```
./scripts/describe-topics.sh
```

Sample output:

```
==> Describe topic single-region

Topic: single-region	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 2	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: single-region	Partition: 0	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1	Isr: 2,1	Offline: 

==> Describe topic multi-region-sync

Topic: multi-region-sync	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}},{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: multi-region-sync	Partition: 0	Leader: 1	Replicas: 1,2,3,4	Isr: 1,2,3,4	Offline: 

==> Describe topic multi-region-async

Topic: multi-region-async	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}]}
	Topic: multi-region-async	Partition: 0	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1,3,4	Isr: 2,1	Offline: 	Observers: 3,4
```

Observations:

* Topic `multi-region-async` has replicas across `west` and `east` regions, but only 1 and 2 are in the ISR, and 3 and 4 are observers.

## Producer Testing
This section tests the differences in replication policies on producers.  Run the producer perf test:

```
./scripts/run-producer.sh
```

Sample output:

```
==> Produce: Single-region Replication (topic: single-region) 
5000 records sent, 240.453977 records/sec (1.15 MB/sec), 10766.48 ms avg latency, 17045.00 ms max latency, 11668 ms 50th, 16596 ms 95th, 16941 ms 99th, 17036 ms 99.9th.

==> Produce: Multi-region Sync Replication (topic: multi-region-sync) 
100 records sent, 2.145923 records/sec (0.01 MB/sec), 34018.18 ms avg latency, 45705.00 ms max latency, 34772 ms 50th, 44815 ms 95th, 45705 ms 99th, 45705 ms 99.9th.

==> Produce: Multi-region Async Replication to Observers (topic: multi-region-async) 
5000 records sent, 228.258388 records/sec (1.09 MB/sec), 11296.69 ms avg latency, 18325.00 ms max latency, 11866 ms 50th, 17937 ms 95th, 18238 ms 99th, 18316 ms 99.9th.

```

Observations:

* In the first and third cases, topics `single-region` and `multi-region-async` have nearly the same throughput performance (e.g., `1.15 MB/sec` and `1.09 MB/sec`, respectively, in the above example), because only the replicas in the `west` region need to ack.
* In the second case for topic `multi-region-sync`, due to the poor network bandwidth between the `east` and `west` regions and due to an ISR made up of brokers in both regions, it took a big throughput hit (e.g., `0.01 MB/sec` in the above example). This is because the producer is waiting for an `ack` from all members of the ISR before continuing, including those in `west` and `east`.
* The observers in the third case for topic `multi-region-async` didn't affect the overall producer throughput because the `west` region is sending an `ack` back to the producer after it has been replicated twice in the `west` region, and it is not waiting for the async copy to the `east` region. 

## Consumer Testing

This section tests the differences in follower fetching in the consumers.  Run the consumer perf test where the consumer is in `east`:

```
./scripts/run-consumer.sh
```

Sample output:

```
==> Consume from east: Multi-region Async Replication reading from Leader in west (topic: multi-region-async)

start.time, end.time, data.consumed.in.MB, MB.sec, data.consumed.in.nMsg, nMsg.sec, rebalance.time.ms, fetch.time.ms, fetch.MB.sec, fetch.nMsg.sec
2019-09-25 17:10:27:266, 2019-09-25 17:10:53:683, 23.8419, 0.9025, 5000, 189.2721, 1569431435702, -1569431409285, -0.0000, -0.0000


==> Consume from east: Multi-region Async Replication reading from Observer in east (topic: multi-region-async)

start.time, end.time, data.consumed.in.MB, MB.sec, data.consumed.in.nMsg, nMsg.sec, rebalance.time.ms, fetch.time.ms, fetch.MB.sec, fetch.nMsg.sec
2019-09-25 17:10:56:844, 2019-09-25 17:11:02:902, 23.8419, 3.9356, 5000, 825.3549, 1569431461383, -1569431455325, -0.0000, -0.0000
```

Observations:

* In the first case, the consumer running in `east` reads from the leader in `west`, and so it is negatively impacted by the low bandwidth between `east` and `west`.  Its throughput is lower (e.g. `0.9025` MB.sec in the above example).
* In the second case, the consumer running in `east` reads from the follower that is also in `east`. Its throughput is higher (e.g. `3.9356` MB.sec in the above example).

## Monitoring Observers

Notice that the `multi-region-async` topic has a JMX metric `ReplicasCount` that includes observers, whereas `InSyncReplicasCount` excludes observers.
The new JMX metric `CaughtUpReplicasCount` (`kafka.cluster:type=Partition,name=CaughtUpReplicasCount,topic=([-.\w]+),partition=([0-9]+)`) across all brokers in the cluster reflects whether all the replicas, including observers, are caught up with the leader such that their log end offset is at least at the high watermark.

```
./scripts/jmx_metrics.sh
```

Sample output:

```
==> Monitor ReplicasCount

single-region: 2
multi-region-sync: 4
multi-region-async: 4


==> Monitor InSyncReplicasCount

single-region: 2
multi-region-sync: 4
multi-region-async: 2


==> Monitor CaughtUpReplicasCount

single-region: 2
multi-region-sync: 4
multi-region-async: 4
```

## Failover and Failback

### Fail region west

```
docker-compose stop broker-west-1 broker-west-2 zookeeper-west
```

Verify the new topic replica placement:

```
./scripts/describe-topics.sh
```

Sample output:

```
==> Describe topic single-region

Topic: single-region	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 2	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: single-region	Partition: 0	Leader: none	Replicas: 2,1	Isr: 1	Offline: 2,1

==> Describe topic multi-region-sync

Topic: multi-region-sync	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}},{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: multi-region-sync	Partition: 0	Leader: 3	Replicas: 1,2,3,4	Isr: 3,4	Offline: 1,2

==> Describe topic multi-region-async

Topic: multi-region-async	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}]}
	Topic: multi-region-async	Partition: 0	Leader: none	Replicas: 2,1,3,4	Isr: 1	Offline: 2,1	Observers: 3,4
```

Observations:

* In the first case, the topic `single-region` has no leader, because it had only two replicas in the ISR, both of which were in the `west` region and are now down.
* In the second case, the topic `multi-region-sync` automatically elected a new leader in `east` (e.g. replica 3 in the above output).  Clients can failover to those replicas in the east region.
* In the third case, the topic `multi-region-async` also has no leader, because it had only two replicas in the ISR, both of which were both in the `west` region and are now down.  The observers in the `east` region are not eligible to become leaders automatically because they were not in the ISR.

### Fail over observers

To explicitly fail over the observers in the topic `multi-region-async` to the `east` region, trigger leader election (note that `unclean` leader election may result in data loss):

```
docker-compose exec broker-east-4 kafka-leader-election --bootstrap-server broker-east-4:19094 --election-type UNCLEAN --topic multi-region-async --partition 0
```

Describe the topics again.

```
./scripts/describe-topics.sh
```

Sample output:

```
...
==> Describe topic multi-region-async

Topic: multi-region-async	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}]}
	Topic: multi-region-async	Partition: 0	Leader: 3	Replicas: 2,1,3,4	Isr: 3,4	Offline: 2,1	Observers: 3,4
...
```

Observations for topic `multi-region-async`:

* It has a leader again (e.g. replica 3 in the above output)
* The observers are now in the ISR list (e.g. replicas 3,4 in the above output)

### Failback region west

```
docker-compose start broker-west-1 broker-west-2 zookeeper-west
```

Wait for 5 minutes, which is the default duration for ``leader.imbalance.check.interval.seconds``, until the leadership election restores the preferred replicas.
(You can also trigger it with `docker-compose exec broker-east-4 kafka-leader-election --bootstrap-server broker-east-4:19094 --election-type PREFERRED --all-topic-partitions`).

Verify the new topic replica placement is restored.

```
./scripts/describe-topics.sh
```

Sample output:

```
Topic: single-region	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 2	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: single-region	Partition: 0	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1	Isr: 1,2	Offline: 

==> Describe topic multi-region-sync

Topic: multi-region-sync	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}},{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}],"observers":[]}
	Topic: multi-region-sync	Partition: 0	Leader: 1	Replicas: 1,2,3,4	Isr: 3,4,2,1	Offline: 

==> Describe topic multi-region-async

Topic: multi-region-async	PartitionCount: 1	ReplicationFactor: 4	Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,confluent.placement.constraints={"version":1,"replicas":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"west"}}],"observers":[{"count":2,"constraints":{"rack":"east"}}]}
	Topic: multi-region-async	Partition: 0	Leader: 2	Replicas: 2,1,3,4	Isr: 2,1	Offline: 	Observers: 3,4
```

Observations:

* All topics have leaders again, in particular `single-region` which lost its leader when the west region failed
* The leaders are restored to the east region. If they are not, then wait a full 5 minutes (duration of ``leader.imbalance.check.interval.seconds``) 

Note: On failback from a failover to observers, any data that was not replicated to observers will be lost because logs are truncated before catching up and joining the ISR.


## Run end-to-end demo

All the individual steps above can be run with this automated script:

```
./scripts/start.sh
```

## Stop demo

Stop the demo and all Docker containers.

```
./scripts/stop.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If containers fail to ping each other (e.g., failures seen in running `./scripts/validate_connectivity.sh`), then stop the demo, clean up the Docker environment, and restart the demo.  If it still fails, restart Docker and run again.

```
# Stop demo
./scripts/stop.sh

# Clean up the Docker environment
for c in $(docker container ls -q --filter "name=pumba"); do docker container stop "$c" && docker container rm "$c"; done
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
for v in $(docker volume ls -q --filter="dangling=true"); do docker volume rm "$v"; done

# Restart demo
./scripts/start.sh
```

2. Pumba may be overloading the Docker inter-container network. Consider tweaking the Pumba settings in [scripts/latency_docker.sh](scripts/latency_docker.sh) and re-test in your environment.
