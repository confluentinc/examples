This example is similar to the previous example, except the value is formatted
as Avro and integrates with the |ccloud| |sr|. Before using |ccloud| |sr|, check
its :ref:`availability and limits <cloud-limits>`.

.. note::

   Your VPC must be able to connect to the |ccloud| |sr| public internet
   endpoint.
