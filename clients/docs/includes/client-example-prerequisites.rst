- You can use this tutorial with a |ak| cluster in any environment:

  - In `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/>`__
  - On your :ref:`local host <quickstart>`
  - Any remote |ak| cluster

- If you are running on |ccloud|, you must have access to a
  `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/>`__ cluster
  with an API key and secret.

  - For an automated way to create a |ak| cluster, credentials, and ACLs in |ccloud|, see :cloud:`ccloud-stack Utility for Confluent Cloud|examples/ccloud/docs/ccloud-stack.html`.
