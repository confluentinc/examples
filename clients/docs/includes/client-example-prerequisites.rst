The easiest way to follow this tutorial is with `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/>`__ because you don't have to run a local |ak| cluster.
When you sign up for `Confluent Cloud <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/>`__, apply promo code ``C50INTEG`` to receive an additional $50 free usage (`details <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-promo-disclaimer/>`__).
To provision a cluster and credentials in |ccloud|, from the Console click on `LEARN <https://confluent.cloud/learn>`__ and follow the instructions to launch an |ak| cluster, then click on `Clients` to get the cluster-specific configurations and credentials to set for your client application.
You can also provision |ccloud| resources using the supported `CLI <https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/>`__ or `REST API <https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/get-started/krest-qs.html>`__, or the community-supported :ref:`ccloud-stack`.

If you don't want to use |ccloud|, you can also use this tutorial with a |ak| cluster running on your :ref:`local host <quickstart>` or any other remote server.
