.. _client-examples-scala:

Scala
======

In this tutorial, you will run a Scala client application that produces messages
to and consumes messages from an |ak-tm| cluster.

.. include:: includes/client-example-overview.rst


Prerequisites
-------------

Kafka Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: includes/client-example-prerequisites.rst


Setup
-----

#. .. include:: includes/clients-checkout.rst

#. Change directory to the example for Scala.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd clients/cloud/scala/

#. .. include:: includes/client-example-create-file-java.rst


Basic Producer and Consumer
---------------------------

.. include:: includes/producer-consumer-description.rst


Consume Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Build the client examples:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sbt clean compile

#. Run the consumer:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sbt “runMain io.confluent.examples.clients.scala.Consumer $HOME/.confluent/java.config test1”

   You should see:

   .. code-block:: text

         <snipped>

         Polling
         ....
         <snipped>

#. View the :devx-examples:`consumer code|clients/cloud/scala/src/main/scala/io/confluent/examples/clients/scala/Consumer.scala`.


Kafka Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In a new window, run the Streams app:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd examples/clients/cloud/scala

#. Build the client examples:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sbt clean compile

#. Run the streams app:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sbt "runMain io.confluent.examples.clients.scala.Streams $HOME/.confluent/java.config  test1"

#. View the :devx-examples:`Kafka Streams code|clients/cloud/scala/src/main/scala/io/confluent/examples/clients/scala/Streams.scala`.


Produce Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. In new a window, run the |ak| producer application to write records to the |ak| cluster:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sbt "runMain io.confluent.examples.clients.scala.Producer $HOME/.confluent/java.config test1"

   You see the following output:

   .. code-block:: text

         <snipped>
         Produced record at test1-0@120
         Produced record at test1-0@121
         Produced record at test1-0@122
         Produced record at test1-0@123
         Produced record at test1-0@124
         Produced record at test1-0@125
         Produced record at test1-0@126
         Produced record at test1-0@127
         Produced record at test1-0@128
         Produced record at test1-0@129
         Wrote ten records to test1
         [success] Total time: 6 s, completed 10-Dec-2018 16:50:13

#. In the consumer window, verify you see the following output:

   .. code-block:: text

         <snipped>
         Polling
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":1}, and updated total count to 1
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":2}, and updated total count to 3
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":3}, and updated total count to 6
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":4}, and updated total count to 10
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":5}, and updated total count to 15
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":6}, and updated total count to 21
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":7}, and updated total count to 28
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":8}, and updated total count to 36
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":9}, and updated total count to 45
         Consumed record with key alice and value {"count":10}, and updated total count to 55
         Polling


#. In the streams app, verify you see the following output:

   .. code-block:: text

        [Consumed record]: alice, 1
        [Consumed record]: alice, 2
        [Consumed record]: alice, 3
        [Consumed record]: alice, 4
        [Consumed record]: alice, 5
        [Consumed record]: alice, 6
        [Consumed record]: alice, 7
        [Consumed record]: alice, 8
        [Consumed record]: alice, 9
        [Consumed record]: alice, 10
        [Running count]: alice, 1
        [Running count]: alice, 3
        [Running count]: alice, 6
        [Running count]: alice, 10
        [Running count]: alice, 15
        [Running count]: alice, 21
        [Running count]: alice, 28
        [Running count]: alice, 36
        [Running count]: alice, 45
        [Running count]: alice, 55

#. When you are done, press ``CTRL-C`` in both windows to stop the Consumer and Streams.

#. View the :devx-examples:`producer code|clients/cloud/scala/src/main/scala/io/confluent/examples/clients/scala/Producer.scala`.
