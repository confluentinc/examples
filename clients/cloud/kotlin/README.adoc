= Kotlin Example Confluent Cloud Client

Produce messages to and consume messages from a Kafka cluster using the Kotlin version of Java Producer and Consumer, and Kafka Streams API.

== Prerequisites

* Java 1.8 or higher to run the demo application

To run this example, update the `example.config` file with configuration parameters to connect to your Kafka cluster, which can be on your local host, [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.examples_type.community_content.clients-ccloud), or any other cluster. If this is a Confluent Cloud cluster, you must have:

* Access to a [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.examples_type.community_content.clients-ccloud) cluster
* Update the `example.config` file with the broker endpoint and api key to connect to your Confluent Cloud cluster ([how do I find those?](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/using/config-client.html#librdkafka-based-c-clients?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.examples_type.community_content.clients-ccloud)).

```shell
$ cat example.config
bootstrap.servers={{ BROKER_ENDPOINT }}
ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username\="{{ CLUSTER_API_KEY }}" password\="{{ CLUSTER_API_SECRET }}";
```

== Example 1: Hello World!

In this example, the producer writes Kafka data to a topic in Confluent Cloud.
Each record has a key representing a username (e.g. `alice`) and a value of a count, formatted as json (e.g. `{"count": 0}`).
The consumer reads the same topic from Confluent Cloud and keeps a rolling sum of the counts as it processes each record.
The Kafka Streams API reads the same topic from Confluent Cloud and does a stateful sum aggregation, also a rolling sum of the counts as it processes each record.

. Run the producer, passing in arguments for (a) the local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance and (b) the topic name:

 # Build the client examples
 $ ./gradlew clean build
	
 # Run the producer
 $ ./gradlew runApp -PmainClass="io.confluent.examples.clients.cloud.ProducerExample" \
 -PconfigPath="$HOME/examples/clients/cloud/kotlin/example.config" \
 -Ptopic="test1"

. Run the consumer, passing in arguments for (a) the local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance and (b) the same topic name as used above.
Verify that the consumer received all the messages:

 # Build the client examples
 $ ./gradlew clean build
	
 # Run the consumer
 $ ./gradlew runApp -PmainClass="io.confluent.examples.clients.cloud.ConsumerExample"\

. Run the Kafka Streams application, , passing in arguments for (a) the local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance and (b) the same topic name as used above.
Verify that the consumer received all the messages:

 # Run the consumer
