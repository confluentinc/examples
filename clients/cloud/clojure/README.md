# Overview

Produce messages to and consume messages from [Confluent
Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) using Java interop
form Clojure.

For more information, please see the [application development documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/api-javadoc.html)

# Prerequisites

* Java 8 or higher (Clojure 1.10 recommends using Java 8 or Java 11)
* The [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/#install) tool to compile and run the demos
* Access to a [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) cluster
* Local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance ([how do I find those?](https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/using/config-client.html#librdkafka-based-c-clients)). Format the file as follows:


```bash
$ cat ~/.ccloud/example.config
bootstrap.servers=<broker-1,broker-2,broker-3>
sasl.username=<api-key-id>
sasl.password=<secret-access-key>
ssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm=https
security.protocol=SASL_SSL
sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
```

# Example 1: Hello World!

In this example, the producer writes Kafka data to a topic in Confluent Cloud.
Each record has a key representing a username (e.g. `alice`) and a value of a count, formatted as json (e.g. `{"count": 0}`).
The consumer reads the same topic from Confluent Cloud and keeps a rolling sum of the counts as it processes each record.

1. Run the producer, passing in arguments for (a) the local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance and (b) the topic name:

```shell
$ lein producer ~/.ccloud/example.config test1
…
Producing record: alice 	{"count":0}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":1}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":2}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":3}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":4}
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 0
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 1
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 2
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 3
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 4
Producing record: alice 	{"count":5}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":6}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":7}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":8}
Producing record: alice 	{"count":9}
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 5
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 6
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 7
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 8
Produced record to topic test1 partiton [0] @ offest 9
10 messages were produced to topic test1!
```

2. Run the consumer, passing in arguments for (a) the local file with configuration parameters to connect to your Confluent Cloud instance and (b) the same topic name as used above. Verify that the consumer received all the messages:

```shell
$ lein consumer ~/.ccloud/example.config test1
…
Waiting for message in KafkaConsumer.poll
