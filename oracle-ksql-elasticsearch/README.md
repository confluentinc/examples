# Overview

This demo shows how to enrich event stream data from Oracle, enriching it with KSQL, and then stream into Elasticsearch.

You may follow the [step-by-step guide](oracle-ksql-elasticsearch-docker.adoc), and that instruction is based on Docker (instead of your local Confluent Platform install).
