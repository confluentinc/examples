# Overview

The Docker-based Role Based Access Control (RBAC) demo is deprecated.

Instead, see [cp-demo](https://docs.confluent.io/current/tutorials/cp-demo/docs/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=demo&utm_campaign=ch.cp-demo_type.community_content.rbac), which is more representative of a real deployment of an Apache KafkaÂ® event streaming application, with RBAC and other Confluent Platform security features and LDAP integration.
