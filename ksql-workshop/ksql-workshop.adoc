== Introduction

[quote]
____
KSQL is the streaming SQL engine for Apache Kafka. Using just SQL it is possible for developers to build powerful stream processing applications. This talk will show practical examples of KSQL:

* Filtering streams of data
* Joining live events with reference data (e.g. from a database)
* Stateful aggregations
* Convert streams from JSON to AVRO
____

== Prerequisites

IMPORTANT: These **MUST** be completed before the workshop!

Please see link:pre-requisites.adoc[]

== Start Confluent Platform

_NOTE: Make sure that Docker has at least 8GB of memory available (check with `docker system info | grep Memory`)_

Change the working directory:

[source,bash]
----
cd examples/ksql-workshop
----

Start Confluent Platform: 

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f kafka|grep "INFO Kafka version"
----

Once you see output then it means Kafka is running and you can proceed

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose logs -f kafka|grep "INFO Kafka version"
kafka_1             | [2018-09-03 14:08:09,790] INFO Kafka version : 2.0.0-cp1 (org.apache.kafka.common.utils.AppInfoParser)
----

Press Ctrl-C twice to exit the `docker-compose logs` command

Run `docker-compose ps` to confirm that all components are running:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose ps
              Name                            Command               State                          Ports

ksql-workshop_zookeeper_1          /etc/confluent/docker/run        Up      2181/tcp, 2888/tcp, 3888/tcp
----

IMPORTANT: If any components do not show "Up" under the `State` column (e.g. they say "Exit") then you must rectify this before continuing. As a first solution, try re-issuing the `docker-compose up -d command`.

== Source Data : Rating events

The event stream driving this example is a simulated stream of events purporting to show the ratings left by users on a website, with data elements including the device type that they used, the star rating, and a message associated with the rating.

=== Inspect the ratings data

Here we use https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat/[`kafkacat` ] for showing the Kafka messages and detailed metadata. 

[source,bash]
----
docker run --network ksql-workshop_default \
          --tty --interactive --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
          kafkacat -b kafka:29092 -C -K: \
          -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\n\Partition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n' \
          -t ratings
----

Note that the data is in Avro, so you will see lots of special characters in the output.

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the command prompt.

NOTE: On Linux the name of the network _may_ be `ksqlworkshop_default` (no `-` between `ksql` and `workshop`). Use `docker network ls` to check, and modify the `docker run` command above (and subsequently in this workshop) accordingly. 

== Source Data : Customers

=== Populate customer data

Depending on time available, and your interest in exploring database integration with Kafka, you may opt for one of the two methods below for getting customer data into Kafka. 

==== Option A: RDBMS

**This shows how to ingest the data using https://www.confluent.io/blog/no-more-silos-how-to-integrate-your-databases-with-apache-kafka-and-cdc[Kafka Connect and CDC]. If you want, you can replace this step with the following one ("Option B").**

Check that Kafka Connect with Debezium's connector has started: 

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose logs -f connect-debezium|grep "Kafka Connect started"
----

Wait for the output: 

[source,bash]
----
connect-debezium_1  | 2018-09-04 11:33:04,639 INFO   ||  Kafka Connect started   [org.apache.kafka.connect.runtime.Connect]
----

Press Ctrl-C to return to the command prompt. 

We'll now create _two_ Kafka Connect connectors. Both stream events from MySQL into Kafka using Debezium, but differ in how they handle the message structure. 

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose exec connect-debezium bash -c '/scripts/create-mysql-source.sh'
----

You should see `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`, twice. 

If you are interested you can inspect the script file (`scripts/create-mysql-source.sh` in the workshop folder) that includes the configuration payload in JSON. 

1. The connector called `mysql-source-demo-customers` flattens the before/after record state data, along with the nested metadata, into a single flat structure. This is what we use during the rest of the workshop. 
+ 
The flattening is done using a *Single Message Transform* from Debezium, called `io.debezium.transforms.UnwrapFromEnvelope`. 
+ The connector also uses two Single Message Transforms to illustrate how metadata can be added to ingested data. The `InsertField` transformation adds the topic name into a field called `messagetopic`, and some fixed text into the `messagesource` field. 

2. The connector `mysql-source-demo-customers-raw` retains the nested structure of the before/after record data.
+
A Single Message Transform is used to route the messages to a different topic. By default Debezium will use the format `server.schema.table` when streaming a table's data to a Kafka topic. We use the `RegexRouter` to redirect the messages to a topic with a `-raw` suffix. 

===== Exploring CDC change records

Start a MySQL command prompt: 

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose exec mysql bash -c 'mysql -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD demo'
----

Now in a separate terminal window run the following, to stream the contents of the customers topic and any changes to stdout: 

[source,bash]
----
# Make sure you run this from the `examples/ksql-workshop` folder
docker-compose exec -T kafka \
      kafka-console-consumer \
      --bootstrap-server kafka:29092 \
      --topic asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS-raw --from-beginning|jq '.'
----

(_https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] is useful here—if you don't have it installed, remove `|jq '.'` from the above command)._

Note the customer data shown, and the structure of it, with `before`, `after`, and `source` data.

From the MySQL command prompt, make some changes to the data: 

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME) VALUES (42,'Rick','Astley');
UPDATE CUSTOMERS SET FIRST_NAME = 'Thomas', LAST_NAME ='Smith' WHERE ID=2;
----

You should see each DML cause an almost-instantaneous update on the Kafka topic. For each change, inspect the output of the Kafka topic. Observe the difference between an `INSERT` and `UPDATE`. 

==== Option B: Manually

If you want to follow the simpler path for this workshop, you can just mock up the data that would be coming from our customers table on a database. In practice you would ingest the data using https://www.confluent.io/blog/no-more-silos-how-to-integrate-your-databases-with-apache-kafka-and-cdc[Kafka Connect and CDC]

Run the following command to send the customer data to the `customers` topic:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --network ksql-workshop_default \
           --interactive --rm \
           --volume $PWD/data:/data confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
           kafkacat -b kafka:29092 \
                    -t asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS \
                    -P -l /data/customers.json
----

Note that there is no output from this command. We will verify its success in the next step.

=== Inspect customer data

Run this command to inspect the content of the main `asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS` topic that we populated. 

[source,bash]
----
docker run --network ksql-workshop_default \
          --tty --interactive --rm \
          confluentinc/cp-kafkacat \
          kafkacat -b kafka:29092 -C -K: \
          -f '\nKey (%K bytes): %k\t\nValue (%S bytes): %s\n\Partition: %p\tOffset: %o\n--\n' \
          -t asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS
----

You should see messages, similar to this:

----
Key (-1 bytes):
Value (168 bytes): {"id":1,"first_name":"Annemarie","last_name":"Arent","email":"aarent0@cpanel.net","gender":"Female","club_status":"platinum","comments":"Organized web-enabled ability"}
Partition: 0    Offset: 0
--
----

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the command prompt.

== KSQL CLI

KSQL can be used via the command line interface (CLI), a graphical UI built into Confluent Control Center, or the documented https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/api.html[REST API].

In this workshop we will use the CLI, which if you have used Oracle's sql*plus, MySQL CLI, and so on will feel very familiar to you.

Launch the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --network ksql-workshop_default \
           --tty --interactive --rm \
           confluentinc/cp-ksql-cli:5.1.2 http://ksql-server:8088
----

Make sure that you get a successful start up screen:

[source,bash]

=== See available Kafka topics

KSQL can be used to view the topic metadata on a Kafka cluster (`SHOW TOPICS;`), as well as inspect the messages in a topic (`PRINT <topic>;`).

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SHOW TOPICS;

=== Inspect a topic contents - Ratings

Using the `PRINT` command we can easily see column names and values within a topic's messages. Kafka messages consist of a timestamp, key, and message (payload), which are all shown in the `PRINT` output.

[TIP]
====
Note that we don't need to know the format of the data; KSQL introspects the data and understands how to deserialise it.
====

[source,sql]
----
ksql> PRINT 'ratings';
Format:AVRO
22/02/18 12:55:04 GMT, 5312, {"rating_id": 5312, "user_id": 4, "stars": 4, "route_id": 2440, "rating_time": 1519304104965, "channel": "web", "message": "Surprisingly good, maybe you are getting your mojo back at long last!"}
22/02/18 12:55:05 GMT, 5313, {"rating_id": 5313, "user_id": 3, "stars": 4, "route_id": 6975, "rating_time": 1519304105213, "channel": "web", "message": "why is it so difficult to keep the bathrooms clean ?"}
----

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the KSQL prompt. 

<<<
=== Inspect a topic contents - Customers

Here we use the `FROM BEGINNING` argument, which tells KSQL to go back to the _beginning_ of the topic and show all data from there

[source,sql]
----
ksql> PRINT 'asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS' FROM BEGINNING;
Format:JSON
{"ROWTIME":1529499994472,"ROWKEY":"null","id":1,"first_name":"Annemarie","last_name":"Arent","email":"aarent0@cpanel.net","gender":"Female","club_status":"platinum","comments":"Organized web-enabled ability"}
{"ROWTIME":1529499994472,"ROWKEY":"null","id":2,"first_name":"Merilyn","last_name":"Doughartie","email":"mdoughartie1@dedecms.com","gender":"Female","club_status":"platinum","comments":"Optimized local definition"}
----

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the KSQL prompt. This may take up to a minute to cancel (https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1759[#1759]). If it still does not cancel then just start a new KSQL CLI using the `docker run` command from above and proceed to the next step. 

<<<
=== KSQL offsets

Since Apache Kafka persists data, it is possible to use KSQL to query and process data from the past, as well as new events that arrive on the topic.

To tell KSQL to process from beginning of topic run `SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';`

Run this now, so that future processing includes all existing data—this is important for the Customer data, since no new messages are arriving on this topic and thus we need to make sure we work with the messages already present.

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' from 'null' to 'earliest'
----

<<<
== Querying and processing the Ratings topic

Having inspected the topics and contents of them, let's get into some SQL now. The first step in KSQL is to register the source topic with KSQL.

=== Register the ratings topic

The inbound event stream of ratings data is a `STREAM`—later we will talk about `TABLE`, but for now, we just need a simple `CREATE STREAM` with the appropriate values in the `WITH` clause:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM ratings WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='ratings', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');

 Message
---------------
 Stream created
---------------
----

=== Describe ratings stream

You'll notice that in the above `CREATE STREAM` statement we didn't specify any of the column names. That's because the data is in Avro format, and the Confluent Schema Registry supplies the actual schema details. You can use `DESCRIBE` to examine an object's columns:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> DESCRIBE ratings;
Name                 : RATINGS
 Field       | Type
-----------------------------------------
 ROWTIME     | BIGINT           (system)
 ROWKEY      | VARCHAR(STRING)  (system)
 RATING_ID   | BIGINT
 USER_ID     | INTEGER
 STARS       | INTEGER
 ROUTE_ID    | INTEGER
 RATING_TIME | BIGINT
 CHANNEL     | VARCHAR(STRING)
 MESSAGE     | VARCHAR(STRING)
-----------------------------------------
For runtime statistics and query details run: DESCRIBE EXTENDED <Stream,Table>;
ksql>
----

Note the presence of a couple of `(system)` columns here. `ROWTIME` is the timestamp of the Kafka message—important for when we do time-based aggregations later— and `ROWKEY` is the key of the Kafka message.

=== Querying data in KSQL

Let's run our first SQL. As anyone familar with SQL knows, `SELECT *` will return all columns from a given object. So let's try it!

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT * FROM ratings;
1529501380124 | 6229 | 6229 | 17 | 2 | 3957 | 1529501380124 | iOS-test | why is it so difficult to keep the bathrooms clean ?
1529501380197 | 6230 | 6230 | 14 | 2 | 2638 | 1529501380197 | iOS | your team here rocks!
1529501380641 | 6231 | 6231 | 12 | 1 | 9870 | 1529501380641 | iOS-test | (expletive deleted)
[…]
----

You'll notice that the data keeps on coming. That is because KSQL is fundamentally a _streaming engine_, and the queries that you run are _continuous queries_. Having previously set the offset to `earliest` KSQL is showing us the *past* (data from the beginning of the topic), the *present* (data now arriving in the topic), and the *future* (all new data that arrives in the topic from now on).

Press Ctrl-C to cancel the query and return to the KSQL command prompt.

To inspect a finite set of data, you can use the `LIMIT` clause. Try it out now:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT * FROM ratings LIMIT 5;
1529499830648 | 1 | 1 | 8 | 1 | 7562 | 1529499829398 | ios | more peanuts please
1529499830972 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 54 | 1529499830972 | iOS | your team here rocks!

Limit Reached

----

=== Filtering streams of data in KSQL

Since KSQL is heavily based on SQL, you can do many of the standard SQL things you'd expect to be able to do, including predicates and selection of specific columns:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT USER_ID, STARS, CHANNEL, MESSAGE FROM ratings WHERE STARS <3 AND CHANNEL='iOS' LIMIT 3;
3 | 2 | iOS | your team here rocks!
2 | 1 | iOS | worst. flight. ever. #neveragain
15 | 2 | iOS | worst. flight. ever. #neveragain
Limit Reached
Query terminated
ksql>
----

== Creating a Kafka topic populated by a filtered stream

image::images/ksql_workshop_02.png[Filtering data with KSQL]

Let's take the poor ratings from people with iOS devices, and create a new stream from them!

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM POOR_RATINGS AS SELECT * FROM ratings WHERE STARS <3 AND CHANNEL='iOS';

 Message
----------------------------
 Stream created and running
----------------------------
----

What this does is set a KSQL continuous query running that processes messages on the source `ratings` topic to:

* applies the predicates (`STARS<3 AND CHANNEL='iOS'``)
* selects just the specified columns
** If you wanted to take all columns from the source stream, you would simply use `SELECT *`

Each processed message is written to a new Kafka topic. Remember, this is a _continuous query_, so every single source message—past, present, and future—will be processed with low-latency in this way.

_This method of creating derived topics is frequently referred to by the acronym of the statement—`CSAS` (-> `CREATE STREAM … AS SELECT`)._

=== Inspect the derived stream

Using `DESCRIBE` we can see that the new stream has the same columns as the source one.

[source,sql]
----
ksql> DESCRIBE POOR_RATINGS;
Name                 : POOR_RATINGS
 Field       | Type

 ROUTE_ID    | INTEGER
 RATING_TIME | BIGINT
 CHANNEL     | VARCHAR(STRING)
 MESSAGE     | VARCHAR(STRING)
-----------------------------------------
For runtime statistics and query details run: DESCRIBE EXTENDED <Stream,Table>;

Additional information about the derived stream is available with the `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` command:

[source,sql]

_N.B. you can use the up arrow on your keyboard to cycle through KSQL command history for easy access and replay of previous commands. Ctrl-R also works for searching command history._

=== Query the stream

The derived stream that we've created is just another stream that we can interact with in KSQL as any other. If you run a `SELECT` against the stream you'll see new messages arriving based on those coming from the source `ratings` topic:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT STARS, CHANNEL, MESSAGE FROM POOR_RATINGS;
1 | iOS | worst. flight. ever. #neveragain
2 | iOS | Surprisingly good, maybe you are getting your mojo back at long last!
2 | iOS | thank you for the most friendly, helpful experience today at your new lounge

=== It's just a Kafka topic…

The query that we created above (`CREATE STREAM POOR_RATINGS AS…`) populates a Kafka topic, which we can also access as a KSQL stream (as in the previous step). Let's inspect this topic now, using KSQL.

Observe that the topic exists:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SHOW TOPICS;

 Kafka Topic        | Registered | Partitions | Partition Replicas | Consumers | ConsumerGroups
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 _confluent-metrics | false      | 12         | 1                  | 0         | 0
 _schemas           | false      | 1          | 1                  | 0         | 0
 customers          | false      | 1          | 1                  | 0         | 0
 POOR_RATINGS       | true       | 4          | 1                  | 0         | 0

== Joining Data in KSQL

image::images/ksql_workshop_03.png[Joining data with KSQL]

Remember our Customer data? Let's bring that into play, and use it to enrich the inbound stream of ratings data to show against each rating who the customer is, and their club status ('platinum','gold', etc). 

=== Prepare the Customer data 

We're going to model the Customers topic as a **KSQL Table**. This is a semantic construct that enables us to work with the data in the topic as key/value pairs, with a single value for each key. You can read more about https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/concepts.html#duality-of-streams-and-tables[this here].

==== Inspect Customers Data

Let's check the data first, using the very handy `PRINT` command:

`PRINT 'asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS' FROM BEGINNING;`

[source,sql]
----
ksql> PRINT 'asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS' FROM BEGINNING;
Format:JSON
{"ROWTIME":1529492614185,"ROWKEY":"null","id":1,"first_name":"Annemarie","last_name":"Arent","email":"aarent0@cpanel.net","gender":"Female","club_status":"platinum","comments":"Organized web-enabled ability"}
----

Press Ctrl-C to cancel and return to the KSQL prompt. This may take up to a minute to cancel (https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1759[#1759]). 

==== Re-Key Customers Topic

When we join the customer data to the ratings, the customer Kafka messages _must be keyed on the field on which we are performing the join_. If this is not the case the join will fail and we'll get `NULL` values in the result.

Our source customer messages are not currently keyed correctly. Depending on how you chose to populate the Customer topic earlier: 

* From Debezium, the messages are actually keyed using the Primary Key of the source table, but using a key serialisation that KSQL does not support - and thus in effect is not useful as a key in KSQL at all
* From a manual input of JSON messages, the key is null (observe the `"ROWKEY":"null"` in the `PRINT` output above)

To re-key a topic in Kafka we can use KSQL!

First we will register the customer topic. Note that because it is in JSON format we need to declare all of the columns and their datatypes:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM CUSTOMERS_SRC (id BIGINT, first_name VARCHAR, last_name VARCHAR, email VARCHAR, gender VARCHAR, club_status VARCHAR, comments VARCHAR) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='asgard.demo.CUSTOMERS', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');

 Message
----------------
 Stream created
----------------
ksql>
----

With the stream registered, we can now re-key the topic, using a KSQL `CSAS` and the `PARTITION BY` clause. Note that we're taking the opportunity to re-serialise the data into Avro format. We're also changing the number of partitions from that of the source (4) to match that of the `ratings` topic (1):

[IMPORTANT]
====
By changing the partition key, data may move between partitions, and thus its ordering change. Kafka's strict ordering guarantee only applies within a partition. 

In our example this doesn't matter, but be aware of this if you rely on this re-keying technique in other KSQL queries.
====

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE STREAM CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY \
        WITH (PARTITIONS=1, VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO') AS \
        SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS_SRC PARTITION BY ID;

 Message
----------------------------
 Stream created and running
----------------------------
ksql>
----

[NOTE]
====
*Optional*

To inspect the key for a given stream/table, use the `ROWKEY` system column.

Here we compare it to the join column (`ID`); for the join to succeed they must be equal.

In the source stream, the `ROWKEY` is null (or `Struct{id=x}` if streamed from Debezium) because the key of the underlying Kafka messages is null:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT C.ROWKEY, C.ID FROM CUSTOMERS_SRC C LIMIT 3;
null | 1
null | 2
null | 3
Limit Reached
Query terminated
----

In the re-keyed stream the `ROWKEY` and `ID` are equal, which is essential for a successful JOIN operation in KSQL.

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT C.ROWKEY, C.ID FROM CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY C LIMIT 3;
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 3
Limit Reached
Query terminated
ksql>
----
====

==== Create Customers Table

Now, create a `TABLE` over the new re-keyed Kafka topic. Why's it a table? Because *for each key* (user id), we want to know *its current value* (name, status, etc)

[source,sql]
----
ksql> CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY', VALUE_FORMAT ='AVRO', KEY='ID');

 Message
---------------
 Table created
---------------
ksql>
----

[NOTE]
====
_n.b. if you get the error `Unable to verify the AVRO schema is compatible with KSQL` then_ :

* Retry the command after a second or two (ref. https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1394[#1394]).
* Check that the topic's source stream is created:
+
[source,sql]
----
ksql> SHOW STREAMS;
 Stream Name         | Kafka Topic         | Format
----------------------------------------------------
 CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY | CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY | AVRO
 [...]
----
+
* Verify that the source stream is processing messages by running `DESCRIBE EXTENDED CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY;`. Under the heading `Local runtime statistics` you should see:
+
[source,sql]
----
Local runtime statistics
------------------------
messages-per-sec:      0.10   total-messages:        10     last-message: 6/28/18 6:23:54 PM UTC
 failed-messages:         0 failed-messages-per-sec:         0      last-failed:       n/a
----
+
** If no 'messages-per-sec' is shown, the next step is to verify that you ran `SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';` earlier. You can run it again to be certain. If it says `Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' from 'null' to 'earliest'` then the `null` shows that it wasn't previously set.
** If this was the case, then you need to drop and recreate the stream in order to process the customer data:
+
[source,sql]
----
TERMINATE QUERY CSAS_CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY_0;
DROP STREAM CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY;
----
+
Then re-run the `CREATE STREAM CUSTOMERS_SRC_REKEY[…]` from above. Use `SHOW QUERIES;` to list the queries running if the name differs from that shown in the `TERMINATE` statement.
====


Query the table:

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, CLUB_STATUS FROM CUSTOMERS;
1 | Annemarie | Arent | aarent0@cpanel.net | platinum
2 | Merilyn | Doughartie | mdoughartie1@dedecms.com | platinum
----


<<<
=== Stream-Table join

Now let's join our ratings data (`RATINGS`), which includes user ID, to our user information (`CUSTOMERS`).

Run the following SQL:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT R.MESSAGE, C.FIRST_NAME, C.LAST_NAME \
FROM RATINGS R INNER JOIN CUSTOMERS C \
ON R.USER_ID = C.ID \
LIMIT 5;
----

There are a couple of things to note about this query :

* We're aliasing the table and stream names to make column names unambiguous
* I'm using the backspace line continuation character

In the output you should see a rating message, and the name of the customer who left it:

[source,sql]
----
more peanuts please | Gianina | Mixhel
your team here rocks! | Munmro | Igounet
airport refurb looks great, will fly outta here more! | null | null
thank you for the most friendly, helpful experience today at your new lounge | Munmro | Igounet
thank you for the most friendly, helpful experience today at your new lounge | null | null
Limit Reached
Query terminated
ksql>
----

Now let's pull the full set of data, including a reformat of the timestamp into something human readable.

[source,sql]
----
SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(R.RATING_TIME, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'), R.RATING_ID, R.STARS, R.ROUTE_ID,  R.CHANNEL, \
R.MESSAGE, C.FIRST_NAME, C.LAST_NAME, C.CLUB_STATUS \
FROM RATINGS R INNER JOIN CUSTOMERS C \
ON R.USER_ID = C.ID;
----

==== Populating a Kafka topic with the results of a Stream-Table join

Let's persist this as an enriched stream, by simply prefixing the query with `CREATE STREAM … AS`:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA WITH (PARTITIONS=1) AS \
SELECT R.RATING_ID, R.CHANNEL, R.STARS, R.MESSAGE, \
       C.ID, C.CLUB_STATUS, C.EMAIL, \
       C.FIRST_NAME, C.LAST_NAME \
FROM RATINGS R \
     INNER JOIN CUSTOMERS C \
       ON R.USER_ID = C.ID ;
----

[source,sql]

=== Filtering an enriched stream

Now that we have customer information added to every rating event, we can easily answer questions such as "Which of our Premier customers are not happy?":

[source,sql]
----
SELECT EMAIL, STARS, MESSAGE \
FROM RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA \
WHERE CLUB_STATUS='platinum' \
  AND STARS <3;
----

[source,sql]

== Daisy-chaining derived streams

image::images/ksql_workshop_04.png[Filtering enriched data with KSQL]

Having enriched the initial stream of ratings events with customer data, we can now persist a filtered version of that stream that includes a predicate to identify just those VIP customers who have left bad reviews:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM UNHAPPY_PLATINUM_CUSTOMERS AS \
SELECT CLUB_STATUS, EMAIL, STARS, MESSAGE \
FROM   RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA \
WHERE  STARS < 3 \
  AND  CLUB_STATUS = 'platinum';
----

[source,sql]
----

 Message
----------------------------
 Stream created and running
----------------------------
ksql>
----

=== Query the new stream

Now we can query the derived stream to easily identify important customers who are not happy. Since this is backed by a Kafka topic being continually popuated by KSQL we can also drive other applications with this data, as well as land it to datastores down-stream for visualisation.

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT STARS, MESSAGE, EMAIL FROM UNHAPPY_PLATINUM_CUSTOMERS;
1 | is this as good as it gets? really ? | aarent0@cpanel.net
2 | airport refurb looks great, will fly outta here more! | aarent0@cpanel.net
2 | meh | aarent0@cpanel.net
----

== Streaming Aggregates

KSQL can create aggregations of event data, either over all events to date (and continuing to update with new data), or based on a time window. The time window types supported are:

* Tumbling (e.g. every 5 minutes : 00:00, 00:05, 00:10)
* Hopping (e.g. every 5 minutes, advancing 1 minute: 00:00-00:05, 00:01-00:06)
* Session (Sets a timeout for the given key, after which any new data is treated as a new session)

To understand more about these time windows, you can read the related https://docs.confluent.io/current/streams/developer-guide/dsl-api.html#windowing[Kafka Streams documentation]. Since KSQL is built on Kafka Streams, the concepts are the same. The https://docs.confluent.io/current/ksql/docs/tutorials/examples.html#aggregating-windowing-and-sessionization[KSQL-specific documentation] is also useful.

image::images/ksql_workshop_05.png[Aggregating data with KSQL]

=== Running Count per Minute

This shows the number of ratings per customer status, per minute:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT CLUB_STATUS, COUNT(*) AS RATING_COUNT \
FROM RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA \
     WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 1 MINUTES) \
GROUP BY CLUB_STATUS;
----

[source,sql]
----
platinum | 1
bronze | 2
gold | 12
bronze | 13
----

Note that the time window itself is not shown in the output here. To access that we need to persist the results. Instead of `CREATE STREAM` as we did above, we're going to instead persist with a `CREATE TABLE`, since aggregates are always a table (key + value). Just as before though, a Kafka topic is continually populated with the results of the query:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS AS \
SELECT CLUB_STATUS, COUNT(*) AS RATING_COUNT \
FROM RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA \
     WINDOW TUMBLING (SIZE 1 MINUTES) \
GROUP BY CLUB_STATUS;
----

[source,sql]
----
 Message
---------------------------
 Table created and running
---------------------------
ksql>
----

In the resulting `TABLE` there are some characteristics to note:

* The `ROWTIME` is the timestamp of the most recent message to arrive in that aggregate.
* The `ROWKEY` is a composite key of the window start timestamp as an epoch, plus the column(s) defined in the `GROUP BY`. It's not currently possible to access the window start/end time programatically from KSQL, but https://github.com/confluentinc/ksql/issues/1674[this is planned].

Using the `ROWKEY` column it's possible to examine the aggregate values:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ROWKEY, \
        CLUB_STATUS, RATING_COUNT \
FROM RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS \
LIMIT 5;
----

[source,sql]
----
platinum : Window{start=1535986500000 end=-} | platinum | 23
silver : Window{start=1535983740000 end=-} | silver | 9
gold : Window{start=1535983740000 end=-} | gold | 39
gold : Window{start=1535983800000 end=-} | gold | 46
platinum : Window{start=1535983980000 end=-} | platinum | 18
Limit Reached
Query terminated
ksql>
----


This table that we've created is just a first class object in KSQL, updated in real time with the results from the aggregate query. Because it's just another object in KSQL, we can query and filter it as any other:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ROWKEY, \
        CLUB_STATUS, RATING_COUNT \
FROM RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS \
WHERE CLUB_STATUS='bronze';
----

[source,sql]
----
bronze : Window{start=1535986740000 end=-} | bronze | 23
bronze : Window{start=1535986800000 end=-} | bronze | 22
bronze : Window{start=1535986860000 end=-} | bronze | 35
bronze : Window{start=1535986920000 end=-} | bronze | 25
bronze : Window{start=1535986980000 end=-} | bronze | 30
----

If you let the `SELECT` output continue to run, you'll see all of the past time window aggregate values—but also the current one. Note that the _current_ time window's aggregate value will continue to update, because new events are being continually processed and reflected in the value. If you were to send an event to the source `ratings` topic with a timestamp in the past, the corresponding time window's aggregate would be re-emitted.

== Optional: Stream data to Elasticsearch

NOTE: This section assumes that you are familiar with the use of Kibana

Using Kafka Connect you can stream data from a Kafka to one (or many) targets, including Elasticsearch, HDFS, S3, and so on.

Here we'll see how to stream it to Elasticsearch for rapid visualisation and analysis.

From a bash prompt, make sure that Elasticsearch and Kibana are running:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose ps|egrep "elasticsearch|kibana"
elasticsearch                      /usr/local/bin/docker-entr ...   Up      0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9300->9300/tcp
kibana                             /usr/local/bin/kibana-docker     Up      0.0.0.0:5601->5601/tcp
----

Create a dynamic mapping in Elasticsearch so that the timestamp of source data is correctly detected:

[source,bash]
----
curl -XPUT "http://localhost:9200/_template/kafkaconnect/" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d' { "index_patterns": "*", "settings": { "number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 0 }, "mappings": { "_default_": { "dynamic_templates": [ { "dates": { "match": "TS", "mapping": { "type": "date" } } }, { "non_analysed_string_template": { "match": "*", "match_mapping_type": "string", "mapping": { "type": "keyword" } } } ] } } }'
----

Create a connector to stream `RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA` to Elasticsearch:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:18083/connectors/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "es_sink_unhappy_platinum_customers",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
    "topics": "RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
    "key.ignore": "true",
    "schema.ignore": "true",
    "type.name": "type.name=kafkaconnect",
    "topic.index.map": "RATINGS_WITH_CUSTOMER_DATA:ratings_with_customer_data",
    "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
    "transforms": "ExtractTimestamp",
    "transforms.ExtractTimestamp.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Value",
    "transforms.ExtractTimestamp.timestamp.field" : "TS"
  }
}'
----

Create a connector to stream `RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS` to Elasticsearch:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:18083/connectors/" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "es_sink_ratings_agg_by_status_1min",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.confluent.connect.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchSinkConnector",
    "topics": "RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS",
    "key.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.StringConverter",
    "key.ignore": "false",
    "schema.ignore": "true",
    "type.name": "type.name=kafkaconnect",
    "topic.index.map": "RATINGS_BY_CLUB_STATUS:ratings_agg_by_status_1min",
    "connection.url": "http://elasticsearch:9200",
    "transforms": "ExtractTimestamp",
    "transforms.ExtractTimestamp.type": "org.apache.kafka.connect.transforms.InsertField$Value",
    "transforms.ExtractTimestamp.timestamp.field" : "TS"
  }
}'
----

_Note that the above sets `"key.ignore": "false"` , and thus aggregates will be updated in-place._

If you have `jq` on your machine you can run this to check that the connector is `RUNNING`: 

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -s "http://localhost:18083/connectors"| jq '.[]'| xargs -I{connector_name} curl -s "http://localhost:18083/connectors/"{connector_name}"/status"| jq -c -M '[.name,.connector.state,.tasks[].state]|join(":|:")'| column -s : -t| sed 's/\"//g'| sort

es_sink_ratings_agg_by_status_1min  |  RUNNING  |  RUNNING
es_sink_unhappy_platinum_customers  |  RUNNING  |  RUNNING
----

Use the Kibana interface (http://localhost:5601) to check that docs are arriving in Elasticsearch:

image::images/kibana_01.png[]

Add the index pattern to Kibana, and then use the Discover and Visualise options to explore and create analyses on the data:

image::images/kibana_02.png[]

image::images/kibana_03.png[]

== Shutting down the environment

To terminate the workshop environment, run `docker-compose down`:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose down
Stopping ksql-workshop_ksql-server_1     ... done
Stopping ksql-workshop_datagen-ratings_1 ... done
Stopping ksql-workshop_schema-registry_1 ... done
Stopping ksql-workshop_kafka_1           ... done
Stopping ksql-workshop_zookeeper_1       ... done

Removing ksql-workshop_kafka_1           ... done
Removing ksql-workshop_zookeeper_1       ... done
Removing network ksql-workshop_default
----

_If you want to preserve the state of all containers, run `docker-compose stop` instead._

== Next steps

With the enriched and filtered data being populated into Kafka topics from KSQL you can use it to :

* Feed event-driven applications. For example, notify the ops team if a VIP user leaves a poor review.
* Stream to analytics platforms. For example, use Kafka Connect to stream the enriched data stream to Elasticsearch and visualise the real time with Kibana.
