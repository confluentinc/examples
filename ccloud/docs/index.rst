On-Prem Kafka to Cloud
======================

This |ccloud| example showcases a hybrid Kafka cluster: one cluster is a self-managed Kafka cluster running locally, the other is a |ccloud| cluster.
The use case is "Bridge to Cloud" as customers migrate from on premises to cloud.

========
Overview
========

The major components of the example are:

* Two Kafka clusters: one cluster is a self-managed cluster running locally, the other is a |ccloud| cluster.
* |c3|: manages and monitors the deployment. Use it for topic inspection, viewing the schema, viewing and creating ksqlDB queries, streams monitoring, and more.
* ksqlDB: Confluent Cloud ksqlDB running queries on input topics `users` and `pageviews` in |ccloud|.
* Two Kafka Connect clusters: one cluster connects to the local self-managed cluster and one connects to the |ccloud| cluster. Both Connect worker processes themselves are running locally.

  * One instance of `kafka-connect-datagen`: a source connector that produces mock data to prepopulate the topic `pageviews` locally
  * One instance of `kafka-connect-datagen`: a source connector that produces mock data to prepopulate the topic `users` in the |ccloud| cluster
  * Confluent Replicator: copies the topic `pageviews` from the local cluster to the |ccloud| cluster

* |sr-long|: the example runs with Confluent Cloud Schema Registry, and the Kafka data is written in Avro format.

.. note:: This is an example environment and has many services running on one host. Do not run this example in production, and
          do not use Confluent CLI in production. This is meant exclusively to easily demo the |cp| and |ccloud|.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

#. An initialized `Confluent Cloud cluster <https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/>`__

#. Local install of `Confluent Cloud CLI <https://docs.confluent.io/ccloud-cli/current/install.html>`__ v1.7.0 or later

#. `Download <https://www.confluent.io/download/>`__ |cp| if using the local install (not required for Docker)

Start Example
=============

Setup
-----

#. This example creates a new |ccloud| environment with required resources to run this example. As a reminder, this example uses real |ccloud| resources and you may incur charges.

#. Clone the `confluentinc/examples <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__ GitHub repository, and check out the :litwithvars:`|release|-post` branch..

   .. codewithvars:: bash

     git clone https://github.com/confluentinc/examples
     cd examples
     git checkout |release|-post

#. Change directory to the |ccloud| example.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

     cd ccloud

Run
---

#. Log in to |ccloud| with the command ``ccloud login``, and use your |ccloud| username and password. The ``--save`` argument saves your |ccloud| user login credentials or refresh token (in the case of SSO) to the local ``netrc`` file.

   .. code:: shell

      ccloud login --save


#. Start the entire example by running a single command.  You have two choices: using Docker Compose or a |cp| local install. This will take several minutes to complete as it creates new resources in |ccloud|.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      # For Docker Compose
      ./start-docker.sh

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      # For Confluent Platform local
      ./start.sh

#. As part of this script run, it creates a new |ccloud| stack of fully managed resources and generates a local configuration file with all connection information, cluster IDs, and credentials, which is useful for other demos/automation. View this local configuration file, where ``SERVICE ACCOUNT ID`` is auto-generated by the script.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      cat stack-configs/java-service-account-<SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>.config

   Your output should resemble:

   ::

|ccloud| CLI
-------------------

#. Validate you can list topics in your cluster.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

     ccloud kafka topic list

#. View the ACLs associated to the service account ``<SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>`` that was created for this example at the start. The resource name corresponds to the respective cluster, Kafka topic name, or consumer group name. Note: in production, you would not use the wildcard ``*``, this is included just for demo purposes.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      ccloud kafka acl list --service-account <SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>

   For example, if the service account ID were 69995, your output would resemble:

   ::

        ServiceAccountId | Permission |    Operation     | Resource |         Name          |   Type

kafka-connect-datagen
---------------------

#. In the example, view :devx-examples:`this code|ccloud/connectors/submit_datagen_pageviews_config.sh` which automatically loads the ``kafka-connect-datagen`` connector for the Kafka topic ``pageviews`` into the ``connect-local`` cluster, which is later replicated by |crep| into |ccloud| (more on |crep| later).

   .. literalinclude:: ../connectors/submit_datagen_pageviews_config.sh
      :lines: 13-29

#. In |c3|, view the data in the ``pageviews`` topic in the local cluster.

   .. figure:: images/topic_pageviews.png
      :alt: image

#. In the example, view :devx-examples:`this code|ccloud/connectors/submit_datagen_users_config.sh` which automatically loads the ``kafka-connect-datagen`` connector for the Kafka topic ``users`` into the ``connect-cloud`` cluster.

   .. literalinclude:: ../connectors/submit_datagen_users_config.sh
      :lines: 13-29

#. In |c3|, view the data in the ``users`` topic in |ccloud|.

   .. figure:: images/topic_users.png
      :alt: image


ksqlDB
------

#. In the example, the Confluent Cloud ksqlDB queries are created from :devx-examples:`statements.sql|ccloud/statements.sql` (for ksqlDB version 0.10.0) using the REST API in :devx-examples:`this code|ccloud/create_ksqldb_app.sh` with proper credentials.

   .. literalinclude:: ../create_ksqldb_app.sh
      :lines: 31-52

#. From the Confluent Cloud UI, view the ksqlDB application flow.

   .. figure:: images/ksqlDB_flow.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on any stream to view its messages and its schema.

   .. figure:: images/ksqlDB_stream_messages.png
      :alt: image


Confluent Replicator
--------------------

Confluent Replicator copies data from a source Kafka cluster to a destination Kafka cluster.
In this example, the source cluster is a local install of a self-managed cluster, and the destination cluster is |ccloud|.
|crep| is replicating a Kafka topic ``pageviews`` from the local install to |ccloud|, and it is running with Confluent Monitoring Interceptors for |c3| streams monitoring.

#. In the example, view :devx-examples:`this code|ccloud/connectors/submit_replicator_docker_config.sh` which automatically loads the |crep| connector into the ``connect-cloud`` cluster. Notice that |crep| configuration sets ``confluent.topic.replication.factor=3``, which is required because the source cluster has ``replication.factor=1`` and |ccloud| requires ``replication.factor=3``:

   .. literalinclude:: ../connectors/submit_replicator_docker_config.sh
      :lines: 13-41
      :emphasize-lines: 8

#. |c3| is configured to manage a locally running connect cluster called ``connect-cloud`` running on port 8087, which is running the ``kafka-connect-datagen`` (for the Kafka topic ``users``) connector and the |crep| connector. From the |c3| UI, view the connect clusters.

   .. figure:: images/c3_clusters.png
      :alt: image

#. Click on `replicator` to view the |crep| configuration. Notice that it is replicating the topic ``pageviews`` from the local Kafka cluster to |ccloud|.

   .. figure:: images/c3_replicator_config.png
      :alt: image

#. Validate that messages are replicated from the local ``pageviews`` topic to the Confluent Cloud ``pageviews`` topic. From the Confluent Cloud UI, view messages in this topic.

   .. figure:: images/cloud_pageviews_messages.png
      :alt: image

#. View the Consumer Lag for |crep| from the |ccloud| UI. In ``Consumers`` view, click on ``connect-replicator``. Your output should resemble:

   .. figure:: images/replicator_consumer_lag.png
      :alt: image


Confluent Schema Registry
-------------------------

The connectors used in this example are configured to automatically write Avro-formatted data, leveraging the |ccloud| |sr|.

#. View all the |sr| subjects.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        # Confluent Cloud Schema Registry
        curl -u <SR API KEY>:<SR API SECRET> https://<SR ENDPOINT>/subjects

#. From the Confluent Cloud UI, view the schema for the ``pageviews`` topic. The topic value is using a Schema registered with |sr| (the topic key is just a String).

   .. figure:: images/topic_schema.png
      :alt: image

#. If you need to migrate schemas from on-prem |sr| to |ccloud| |sr|, follow this :ref:`step-by-step guide <schemaregistry_migrate>`. Refer to the file :devx-examples:`submit_replicator_schema_migration_config.sh|ccloud/connectors/submit_replicator_schema_migration_config.sh#L13-L33>` for an example of a working Replicator configuration for schema migration.

===============================
Confluent Cloud Configurations
===============================

#. View the the template delta configuration for Confluent Platform components and clients to connect to Confluent Cloud:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        ls template_delta_configs/

#. Generate the per-component delta configuration parameters, automatically derived from your Confluent Cloud configuration file:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        ./ccloud-generate-cp-configs.sh

#. If you ran this example as `start-docker.sh`, configurations for all the |cp| components are available in the :devx-examples:`docker-compose.yml file|ccloud/docker-compose.yml`.

   ::

        # For Docker Compose
        cat docker-compose.yml

#. If you ran this example as `start.sh` which uses Confluent CLI, it saves all configuration files and log files in the respective component subfolders in the current Confluent CLI temp directory (requires example to be actively running):

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        # For Confluent Platform local install using Confluent CLI
        ls `confluent local current | tail -1`


===========================
Troubleshooting the example
===========================

#. If you ran with Docker, then run `docker-compose logs | grep ERROR`.

#. To view log files, look in the current Confluent CLI temp directory (requires example to be actively running):

   .. sourcecode:: bash

        # View all files
        ls `confluent local current | tail -1`

        # View log file per service, e.g. for the Kafka broker
        confluent local services kafka log

=================
Destroy resources
=================

.. include:: includes/ccloud-examples-terminate.rst

#. Stop the example, destroy all resources in |ccloud| and local components. As an argument to the script, pass in the path to the local configuration file and substitute ``<SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>`` to match what was auto-generated when you started the demo.

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      # For Docker Compose
      ./stop-docker.sh stack-configs/java-service-account-<SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>.config

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      # For Confluent Platform local install using Confluent CLI
      ./stop.sh stack-configs/java-service-account-<SERVICE ACCOUNT ID>.config

#. Always verify that resources in |ccloud| have been destroyed.
