The Connect worker is backed to the origin on-prem Kafka cluster, which can have a varied set of security features enabled, but for simplicity in this example we show no security configurations, just PLAINTEXT.

   replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   config.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   offset.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   status.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>

The Connect workerâ€™s admin client requires connection information to the onprem cluster.
