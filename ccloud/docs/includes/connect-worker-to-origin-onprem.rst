The Connect worker is backed to the origin on-prem Kafka cluster, so set the replication factor required for the origin onprem cluster:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   config.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   offset.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>
   status.storage.replication.factor=<replication-factor-onprem>

The origin on-prem Kafka cluster can have a varied set of security features enabled, but for simplicity in this example we show no security configurations, just PLAINTEXT.
The Connect workerâ€™s admin client requires connection information to the onprem cluster.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   
   bootstrap.servers=<bootstrap-servers-onprem>
