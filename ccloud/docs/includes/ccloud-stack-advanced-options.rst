This example uses the :cloud:`ccloud-stack utility for Confluent Cloud|examples/ccloud/docs/ccloud-stack.html` to automatically
create a stack of fully managed services in |ccloud|. By default, the ``ccloud-stack`` utility creates resources in a
new |ccloud| environment in cloud provider ``aws`` in region ``us-west-2``. If you want to reuse an existing |ccloud|
environment, or if ``aws`` and ``us-west-2`` are not the target provider and region, you may configure
:cloud:`other ccloud-stack options|examples/ccloud/docs/ccloud-stack.html#ccloud-stack-options` before you run this example.
