Best Practices for Developing Apache Kafka® Applications on Confluent Cloud
===========================================================================

Confluent recommends the following best practices for developing, tuning, and
monitoring Apache Kafka® applications on |ccloud|:

-  :ref:`Getting set up with Confluent Cloud <https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/index.html>`

-  :ref:`Monitoring and measuring the performance of your deployment <ccloud-monitoring>`

-  :ref:`Optimizing and tuning your client application <ccloud-optimizing>`

These best practices are generally applicable to a Kafka client application
written in any language. For more information on configuration parameters, topic
overrides, and other configuration parameters needed to develop Kafka
applications on Confluent Cloud, see the `Confluent Platform
<https://docs.confluent.io>`__ documentation page. You may also refer to `GitHub
examples <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__ with demos for building
event streaming applications with |ccloud|.
