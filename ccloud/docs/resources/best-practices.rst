Best Practices for Developing Apache Kafka® Applications on Confluent Cloud
===========================================================================

Confluent recommends the following best practices for developing, tuning, and
monitoring Apache Kafka® applications on |ccloud|:


-  Getting up and running with the `Confluent Cloud Quick Start
   <https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cloud-quickstart/index.html#cloud-quickstart>`__.

-  Configuring your developed `Kafka client application
   <https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/index.html>`__ to produce to and
   consume from an Apache Kafka® cluster in |ccloud|.

   See :ref:`clients-all-examples` for client examples written in specific
   programming languages and tools.

-  `Managing schemas using the Confluent Cloud Schema Registry
   <https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/cloud-quickstart/schema-registry.html#cloud-sr-config>`__

-  `Securing your Confluent deployment <https://docs.confluent.io/current/security/index.html>`__

-  `Managing your topics in Confluent Cloud
    <https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/using/topics/manage.html#cloud-topics-manageAuthorizing>`__

-  :ref:`Optimizing and tuning your client application <ccloud-optimizing>`


These best practices are generally applicable to a Kafka client application
written in any language. For more information on configuration parameters, topic
overrides, and other configuration parameters needed to develop Kafka
applications on Confluent Cloud, see the `Confluent Platform
<https://docs.confluent.io>`__ documentation page. You may also refer to `GitHub
examples <https://github.com/confluentinc/examples>`__ with demos for building
event streaming applications with |ccloud|.
