|ccloud| Demos
==============

`Confluent Cloud <https://docs.confluent.io/current/cloud/index.html>`__ is a resilient, scalable streaming data service based on |ak|, delivered as a fully managed service. It has a web interface and local command-line interface that you can use to manage cluster resources, |ak| topics, |sr|, and other services.

This repo has a few resources to help you validate your solutions on |ccloud|.


=======
Caution
=======

All demos that connect to |ccloud| use real |ccloud| resources.
To avoid unexpected charges, carefully evaluate the cost of resources before launching any demo and ensure all resources are destroyed after you are done running it.

These demos are meant for development environments only.
Do not run any demo against your production |ccloud| cluster.
These scripts create environments, clusters, topics, ACLs, service accounts, applications, and other resources.
The scripts provide functions to delete created resources; however, you should verify the deletion of all demo resources manually.

Demos

|ccloud| Quickstart
--------------------------

The :devx-examples:`Confluent Cloud Quickstart|cp-quickstart/` is an automated version of the :ref:`Confluent Platform Quickstart <quickstart>`, but this one runs in |ccloud|.

Fully Managed Stack in |ccloud|
-------------------------------

The :devx-examples:`ccloud stack|ccloud/ccloud-stack/README.md` creates a stack of fully managed services in |ccloud|.
Executed with a single command, it is a quick way to create fully managed components in |ccloud|, which you can then use for learning and building other demos.
Do not use this in a production environment.
The script uses the |ccloud| CLI to dynamically do the following in |ccloud|:

-  Create a new environment.
-  Create a new service account.
-  Create a new Kafka cluster and associated credentials.
-  Enable |sr-ccloud| and associated credentials.
-  Create a new KSQL app and associated credentials.
-  Create ACLs with wildcard for the service account.
-  Generate a local configuration file with all above connection information, useful for other demos/automation.

Client Code Examples
--------------------

If you are looking for code examples of producers writing to and consumers reading from |ccloud|, or producers and consumers using Avro with |sr-long|, refer to the :devx-examples:`client examples|clients/cloud/README.md`.
It provides client examples written in various programming languages.

|ccloud| CLI
------------

The :devx-examples:`Confluent Cloud CLI demo|ccloud/beginner-cloud/README.md` is a fully scripted demo that shows users how to interact with |ccloud| using the |ccloud| CLI.
It steps through the following workflow:

-  Create a new environment and specify it as the default.
-  Create a new Kafka cluster and specify it as the default.
-  Create a user key/secret pair and specify it as the default.
-  Produce and consume with |ccloud| CLI.
-  Create a service account key/secret pair.
-  Run a Java producer: before and after ACLs.
-  Run a Java producer: showcase a Prefix ACL.
-  Run Connect and kafka-connect-datagen connector with permissions.
-  Run a Java consumer: showcase a Wildcard ACL.
-  Delete the API key, service account, Kafka topics, Kafka cluster, environment, and the log files.

Cloud ETL
---------

The :ref:`cloud ETL demo <cloud-etl>` showcases a cloud ETL solution leveraging all fully-managed services on |ccloud|.
Using |ccloud| CLI, the demo creates a source connector that reads data from an AWS Kinesis stream into |ccloud|, then a |ccloud| KSQL application processes that data, and then a sink connector writes the output data into cloud storage in the provider of your choice (GCP GCS, AWS S3, or Azure Blob).

Hybrid Cloud
------------

The :ref:`hybrid cloud demo <quickstart-demos-ccloud>` and playbook showcase a hybrid Kafka deployment: one cluster is a self-managed cluster running locally, the other is a |ccloud| cluster.
Data streams into topics, in both the local cluster and the |ccloud| cluster. |crep| copies the on-prem data to |ccloud| so that stream processing can happen in the cloud.

Confluent Operator with Cloud
-----------------------------

The :ref:`Kubernetes demo <quickstart-demos-operator-replicator-gke-cc>` features a deployment of |cp| on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) leveraging Confluent Operator and |crep|, highlighting a data replication strategy to |ccloud|.
Upon running this demo, you will have a GKE-based |cp| deployment with simulated data replicating to your |ccloud| cluster.

Self Managed Components to |ccloud| 
-----------------------------------

This :devx-cp-all-in-one:`Docker-based environment|cp-all-in-one-cloud` can be used with |ccloud|.
The ``docker-compose.yml`` launches all services in |cp| (except for the Kafka brokers), runs them in containers on your local host, and automatically configures them to connect to |ccloud|.
Using this as a foundation, you can then add any connectors or applications.

Auto-generate Configurations to connect to |ccloud|
---------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`configuration generation script <auto-generate-configs>` reads a configuration file and auto-generates delta configurations for all |cp| components and clients.
Use these per-component configurations for |cp| components and clients connecting to |ccloud|:

* |cp| Components:

  * |sr|

  * |ksql-cloud| Data Generator

  * |ksql-cloud|

  * |crep-full|

  * |c3|

  * |kconnect-long|

  * Kafka connector

  * |ak| command line tools

* Kafka Clients:

  * Java (Producer/Consumer)

  * Java (Streams)

  * Python

  * .NET

  * Go

  * Node.js

  * C++

* OS:

  * ENV file
