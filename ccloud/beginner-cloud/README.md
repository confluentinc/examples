# Beginner Cloud

[This beginner demo](start.sh) is a fully scripted demo that shows users how to interact with Confluent Cloud using the CLI.
It steps through the following workflow.

2. Create a Service Account and API key and secret
3. Produce and consume with Confluent Cloud CLI
4. Run a Java client: before and after ACLs
5. Showcase a Prefix ACL
6. Showcase a Wildcard ACL
7. Run Connect and kafka-connect-datagen connector with permissions
8. Delete the API key, service account, Kafka topics, and some of the local files
