This example has been validated with the following operating system and software versions:

- macOS 10.15.3
- |cp| |release|
- Java 11.0.6 2020-01-14 LTS
- bash version 3.2.57
- jq 1.6
- (Docker examples) Docker version 19.03.8
- (Docker examples) Docker Compose docker-compose version 1.25.4

Note for Windows users: even though |cp| is not supported on Windows (see :ref:`interoperability-versions), the example may still work if you replace the symlink ``.env`` with the contens of :devx-examples:`config.env|utils/config.env`.
